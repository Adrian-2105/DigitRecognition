# DigitRecognition in PyTorch

This repository contains a simple example of a digit recognizer designed in PyTorch using the MNIST model, specially designed as an introduction to deep neural networks (DNN). It does not require much previous knowledge for its understanding, but it would be advisable to know the basic principles of neural networks.

- I recommend this playlist, especially chapter 1, in case you're starting from scratch: [Neural Networks - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

## Requirements

To be able to run the program, the following `pip` packages are needed:

```
numpy
torch
torchvision
matplotlib
```

It can be installed with:
```
pip install numpy torch torchvision matplotlib
```

Also, I recommend you to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) to run the script in blocks. You can also install on Ubuntu with:
```
apt-get install jupyter
```

In my case, I use PyCharm for the development of these scripts, which brings native compatibility with them.

## How to run it

Just open the Jupyter Notebook and open the file `DigitRecognition.ipynb`. If you have installed it as I have said previously:

```
jupyter-notebook <REPOSITORY-PATH>/DigitRecognition.ipynb
```

Once opened, just run the code cells in the order indicated :-)
